## Requirments

These are a series of modules/tools required for the project to properly run. 

- C++ 17
- CMake
- SQL 
- SQLite
- Qt 6

### Recommendation

The following platforms are suggestions to facilitate working with program and coding in general. These are not required for the project to build/compile, but to simply improve visualization of data structure, tracking work flow, or/and help with systematic coding.

- [Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip)
- [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/ "Git Kraken")
- [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6)

Clion is the recommended IDE for coding any c++ related projects. Since CMake is used as the c++ packet manager, CLion provides different tools that can be used to improve coding along with Cmake CLI. DataGrip is used for SQL codes. The IDE enables programmers to concurrently use multiple different data management systems, such as Oracle RDBMS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and etc. in a templated project. Git Karaken enables programers to visualize git tracking, commits, and branches.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlumLariat/Project-2-CS1D.git
cd Project-2-CS1D
git checkout main
```
## Usage

Your agile team is to write an application that stores the given National Basketball Association (NBA) information into an ordered or unordered map (not using the map or unordered map STL or the QT map). The underlying data structure of the map is the choice of the team. The map should store either the arenas and/or the souvenirs. The application will allow basketball fans to plan their dream vacation.
